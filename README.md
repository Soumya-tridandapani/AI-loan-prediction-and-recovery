#AI Loan Prediction and Recovery System
This project presents a comprehensive AI-powered framework designed to help financial institutions assess loan risk and recommend personalized recovery strategies. By leveraging borrower data—including financial history, employment details, and past repayment behavior—the system predicts the likelihood of loan default and supports informed, data-driven decision-making.

At its core, the solution uses machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost) to identify patterns in loan behavior while balancing risk, fairness, and business value. Special emphasis is placed on transparency, ethical AI, and actionable insights.

Key Capabilities:
Loan Default Prediction: Classifies borrowers by risk level using real-world data and machine learning.

Cost-Based Risk Analysis: Incorporates business impact by evaluating the financial cost of false approvals and false rejections to maximize ROI.

Bias and Fairness Audits: Uses fairness tools to ensure the model doesn’t disproportionately affect sensitive groups (e.g., age, gender).

Model Explainability: Applies SHAP values to highlight feature importance both globally and for individual predictions, making decisions interpretable for all stakeholders.

Recovery Recommendations: Maps prediction outcomes to suggested actions—such as reminders, loan restructuring, or escalation—based on risk probability.

Technical Highlights:
Data preprocessing: handling missing values, outliers, skewed distributions

Balanced classification using SMOTE for imbalanced datasets

Applied explainability techniques including SHAP, Anchors, and Counterfactuals

Streamlit-based interface for interactive visualization and testing

This project goes beyond traditional ML pipelines by connecting predictions with real-world actions—creating a powerful tool that blends automation, ethics, and financial insight.
