AI-Powered Loan Default Prediction and Recovery System
This project delivers an end-to-end intelligent system for predicting loan default risks and recommending personalized recovery actions. It is designed to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions, reducing non-performing assets, and optimizing recovery efforts using data-driven strategies.

The system leverages a combination of advanced machine learning techniques, explainability frameworks, and domain-aligned business logic to predict which borrowers are likely to default and what interventions might be most effective. The focus extends beyond accurate prediction — this project also emphasizes ethical AI, cost-sensitive decision-making, and actionable insights, which are critical in the financial services sector.

 Project Goals
Improve loan risk assessment through predictive modeling.

Enable recovery-focused decision-making by recommending follow-up actions based on predicted risk.

Ensure fairness, accountability, and transparency in automated decisions.

Minimize financial loss by reducing costly misclassifications, especially false negatives.

 Key Features
1. Default Prediction Using Machine Learning
The system is trained on real-world lending data, incorporating features like loan amount, repayment history, employment type, work experience, and financial behavior. It uses algorithms such as XGBoost and Random Forest to classify borrowers into risk categories.

2. Cost-Sensitive Risk Analysis
To prioritize financial impact, the model evaluates the cost of misclassification:

False Negatives (missed defaulters) can result in significant financial losses.

False Positives (denying credit to good borrowers) may reduce lending opportunities.
This insight helps shift model tuning from pure accuracy to ROI-focused performance.

3. Fairness and Bias Auditing
The system integrates fairness checks to detect potential biases based on sensitive attributes like age, gender, or employment type. Tools like DeepChecks are used to ensure compliance with fair lending laws and ethical standards.

4. Explainable AI (XAI)
To build trust among stakeholders, the model incorporates explainability via:

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret global and local feature importance.

Anchors and Counterfactual Explanations to offer understandable, rule-based justifications for model predictions and suggest "what-if" scenarios.

5. Recovery Strategy Recommendation Engine
Based on risk predictions, the system suggests next steps such as:

Sending automated reminders

Proposing loan restructuring

Triggering legal escalation
These rules are customizable and simulate how actual recovery teams might respond.

6. Streamlit Frontend Interface
A clean, interactive dashboard built using Streamlit allows users to:

Upload or inspect borrower data

See prediction outcomes and recovery recommendations

Visualize SHAP-based explanations in real-time

 Technical Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, normalized numerical fields, managed outliers, and encoded categorical features.

Feature Engineering: Created meaningful derived features such as “Received Principal vs. Loan Amount” and payment consistency metrics.

Imbalance Handling: Applied SMOTE to address class imbalance and improve model generalization.

Model Evaluation: Used precision, recall, F1-score, and cost metrics aligned with business goals.

Explainability Tools: Applied SHAP, Anchor Explainers, and Counterfactuals from libraries like shap and alibi.

Deployment: Developed a Streamlit web application for interactive access and testing.

 Data Summary
Total records: ~143,000+

Data tables: Loan Info, Personal Info, Employment, and Other Metadata

Preprocessing: Null handling, feature flagging, and dimensionality reduction applied

Privacy Consideration: Fields like ‘Pincode’ removed or anonymized to ensure data protection

 Recommendations for Real-World Use
Regularly retrain and audit the model with updated data to maintain accuracy and fairness.

Integrate recovery logic into CRM systems for automated action.

Use dashboards to present explainability outputs to credit officers and compliance teams.

Periodically review model assumptions (cost per false negative, feature thresholds) with domain experts.

 Technologies Used
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, imbalanced-learn)

Streamlit for UI

SHAP, Alibi for Explainable AI

Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

SMOTE for class imbalance handling

 Outcome
This project showcases how data science can go beyond building accurate models — by integrating business logic, ethical AI practices, and actionable recovery plans, it becomes a valuable tool for risk management and financial sustainability. It reflects a full-stack ML solution that balances prediction, transparency, and real-world utility.
